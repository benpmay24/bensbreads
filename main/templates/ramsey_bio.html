                  <p>On April 5th 2021, Ramsey (originally named "Dragonfly" :/) was born on a farm near Shiloh, TN. She had many other australian brothers and sisters that she were probably frolicking around with in her first days. She also got her tail chopped off at the age of 1 day old, but im pretty sure she didn't even notice. Above is the first know picture of her existence.</p>

She was met there by two other dogs, Cici (golden doodle) and Bear (nobody knows). As shown, Ramsey and Cici almost immediately bonded, while Bear mostly just tried to ignore whatever was happening.</p>

                  <p>From Tennessee, Ramsey set out for Boston, MA where she would have to take her first plane ride at the age of less than 3 months old. Once she arrived, she settled in quickly and would spend her afternoons exploring the Boston Commons. She became such a spectacle in the neighborhood, that it was a common for her to draw larger crowds of tourists than the nearby historical landmarks.</p>

                  <p>Soon enough, Ramsey was college-bound and went to study at Auburn University in Alabama. She enjoyed the cool fall weather, mainly because she could jump around in (and eat) the fallen leaves. Even though she was new on campus, she had no problems making friends, with many traveling out to her remote compound just for her. She faced her first big challenge as a pup, in the form of a (mostly) friendly rivalry with her roommate, Nala, a 60 lb German Shepherd. She was intimidated by Nala's intense play style, teaching her not to trust every dog she comes across, but this didn't kill her loving and playful spirit.</p>

                  <p>One April morning, Ramsey was going out for a coffee, when she spotted something on the side of the road that she simply couldn't resist. Overwhelmed with excitement, she leaped out of the car window, not realizing how hard of a fall it would be. She was rushed to the vet hospital and was found to have broken her hind left femur. Even while in great pain and fear, Ramsey was incredibly brave, never whining or crying. The surgery to repair her leg went incredibly smoothly and she was lauded for being a perfect patient. Immediately upon returning home, she was already acting like the energetic and silly girl that she always was, and she even had to be held back from running around too much. One perk of the situation is that she got a new outfit, a bright blue onesie that would make sure she doesn't lick her wounds. Within a month, Ramsey had made a full recovery and was back to frolicking around Auburn's plains.</p>

                  <p>After a brief stint back in Collierville, Ramsey flew out once again to California to move in to a packed house in Menlo Park, with 4 humans and 1 other dog. She soon encountered some great joys and some great challenges during this period of her life. She enjoyed neighboring a large grassy field with a dog park where she enjoyed the lovely weather year-round and the company of the local dogs. Also, having many roommates meant a constant supply of belly rubs from her human friends Will, Spencer, and Bobby. However, she was not the only one in the house competing for attention. She spent nearly all of this 3 year period sharing a space with Freyja, a 40lb husky/boxer mix, and their relationship was very fragile. Also, with her owner working a full-time job, she began to feel a bit lonely during the days. Through it all, she maintained her joy, affection, and loyalty that makes her such a wonderful dog.</p>

                  <p>May 2025 would become known as "Ramsey Month" beacuse she spent it in her paradise. For 4 weeks, she lived in Montara, California, a small beach town on the pacific coast. She was surrounded by everything that she loved- open plains, beaches, squirrels, gophers, etc. She would take evening strolls jumping around the grassy hills, (unsuccessfully) hunting moles and squirrels and on the weekends, exploring the nearby towns. The beach may be her favorite place of all, but she can't resist trying to eat so many washed-up clams that she becomes sick. While she was sad to leave, she had logged yet another great adventure in her catalog and will undoubtedly return to take on the coast once again.</p>
